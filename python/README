This is Python library to access PCI device memory via sysfs.
It replaces 'devmem' or 'mem' commands for Python programs.

Works with Python 2.7 and 3.5.
For Linux only. Requires root.

Example:

   See the test in pymem.py
   To run:  python -m pymem



## Methods in pymem module

 * Cmmdev(devpath, bar_num, winsize) - creates mapping for given PCI device and BAR

Methods of the mapping object:

 * memr4(offs)     - read 32-bit value from offset offs
 * memw4(offs, v)  - write 32-bit value to offset offs
 * memr2(offs)     - read 16-bit value from offset offs
 * memw2(offs, v)  - write 16-bit value to offset offs
 * memr1(offs)     - read 8-bit value from offset offs
 * memw1(offs, v)  - write 8-bit value to offset offs
 * memr(offs)      - same as memr4
 * memw(offs, v)   - same as memw4
