This is Python library to access PCI device BARs and config space via sysfs.

Works with Python 2.7 and 3.5.
For Linux only. Requires root.

TODO: Support also mapping /dev/mem by offset. add another ctor or whatever.
TODO: Support several instances of devices with same PCI HW ID (code already exists in pcidev_sysfs.py)

## Methods in pymem module

 * Cmmdev(devpath, bar_num, winsize) - Constructor. Returns a mapping object for given PCI device and BAR
 

Methods of the mapping object:

 * read32(offs)      - read 32-bit value from offset offs
 * write32(offs, v)  - write 32-bit value to offset offs
 * read16(offs)      - read 16-bit value from offset offs
 * write16(offs, v)  - write 16-bit value to offset offs
 * read8(offs)       - read 8-bit value from offset offs
 * write8(offs, v)   - write 8-bit value to offset offs
 * memfill32(offs, val, cnt=1) - fill memory (32-bit)
 * memr(offs)        - same as read32
 * memw(offs, v)     - same as write32

The offset must be aligned on the operation size (4 or 2 bytes).
 
 
## Example

    import pymem as pm, pcidev_sysfs

    devpath = pcidev_sysfs.getPCIdeviceSysfsPath(vendor_id=0x1234, dev_id=0x5678)
    assert devpath

    MM = pm.Cmmdev(devpath, 0, 0x10000)
    assert MM

    if MM.read32(0) & 0x1 :
        MM.write32(4, 42)
    MM.memfill32(0x20, 0xFF, 16)
